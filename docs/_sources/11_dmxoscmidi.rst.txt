DMX OSC MIDI
=========================

This section is for recording and playback DMX, ArtNet, sACN and remote controlling via OSC, Midi, UDP or DMX

see video tutorial for recording/playback: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/37/pocketvj-exhibition_dmx_in_out_recording

see video tutorial for remote controlling: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/14/pocketvj-exhibition-artnet-dmx-remote-control

.. note:: 
    Art-Net is able to drive up to 4 universes.

    The other protocols (DMX, sACN...) are nearly unlimited.

    Keep in mind not to address universe 15, since this universe is reserved for remote controlling the PocketVJ and is excluded for 
    example from dmxblackout or dmx recording functions.

  
 
OLA
*****

.. image:: _images/11_CP_dmx_osc_midi_ola.png


**Start** => Start OLA, this is necessary to activate DMX, ArtNet, sACN


**Open Panel** => Opens the seperate control panel to create Universes

**Daemon on** => Enables ola always when PocketVJ boots, (turn off when not used!)

**Daemon off** => Turns off ola and the olad daemon

DMX Remote
**********

.. note::
    - Create the remote listener on universe 15. 
    - If you send control commands via ArtNet over RJ45 make sure not to be connected via Wifi and having a DMX Monitor in the browser open, since this would give you a loop and will end in weird behavior.


**DMX Remote ON** => enables the DMX remote control on Universe 15

**DMX Remote OFF** => disables the DMX remote control on Universe 15

find the remote commands here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-exh/master/sync/artnet.conf




OLA PANEL
*********

Add a Universe:

Select Universe ID and device:

Save:

Open Monitor:

DMX RECORDER
************

.. image:: _images/11_CP_dmx_osc_midi_recorder.png

**Stop Recording** => Stop Recording

**REC Show** => Record Show

.. note::
    REC Show01 will record on Universe 1-14, Universe 15 is reserved for the remote. If you need to record more universes there must be made a modification, write me an email!


Universe
*********

**Change to 1** => change all recorded tracks to Universe 1 (this will be deprecated soon! its better to have a flip OLA in/out function)


DMX PLAYER
***********


**1.0 Entry field** => Here you enter the delay time in seconds.milliseconds until the audio/video starts

**Set Delay** =>  Set the entered delay time

.. note::
    The delay will be used for all recorded shows the same, if you need them separate, write me an email

    ArtNet playback is limited to 4 Universes by firmware and can not be extended.

    **If ArtNet somehow does not playback** on your hardware, make a factory reset on the PocketVJ, this might fix some issues.


**Show01** => Plays DMX Show01

**Show01/01_Audio** => Plays DMX Show01 together with 01_audio.mp3

**Show01/01_Video** => Plays DMX Show01 together with 01_video.mp4


ArtNet/DMX Remote Control
***************************

``1    128-255 `/var/www/sync/stopall```

See all commands here: https://github.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-exh/blob/master/sync/artnet.conf


Autostart to OSC/ArtNet/UDP


.. note::
    You can also use any ArtNet node. I successfully tested with Eurolite dxt series Node IV.

    Make sure to use the right IP address in your node, somtimes the node must be restarted to take the IP change.

OSC
*****

.. image:: _images/11_CP_dmx_osc_midi_ola_oscmidi.png


**Start Listen** => Starts to listen for OSC commands on port ``9876``

List of OSC commands: https://github.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-exh/blob/master/sync/osc_control.js 


**Download TouchOSC** => Download the TouchOSCÂ layout contributed by Cornelius Henke:

To send OSC from your computer, you can use https://hexler.net/touchosc

.. image:: _images/11_osc_sending.png



There are many tools on the market which can send OSC commands.
For example OSCulator or QLAB.

.. note::
    Make sure you are not blocked by a firewall if the command does not get through to the player!


To send OSC commands under Debian Linux from terminal(sudo apt install liblo-tools):

``oscsend 192.168.2.100 9876 /pause``

or sendosc for all platforms: https://github.com/yoggy/sendosc

``sendosc 2.0.10.102 9876 /testscreen``




MIDI
*****

see video tutorial: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/9/pocketvj-exhibition-midi-control

List of Midi commands: https://github.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-exh/blob/master/sync/midicontrol.cfg

You can add more Midi commands yourself in /var/www/sync/midicontrol.cfg
or kindly ask me to add the features you need.


MIDI RECORDER
***************
This is new function, not very tested yet, but should work as expected.

When hitting Record it will record all incoming midi signals and on play it should playback them. Currently only working when your usb-midi device is on number:20 , should be on default if no other usb thing is plugged in.
