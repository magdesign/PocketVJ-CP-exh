SYSTEM SETTINGS
================

INFO
****

Get some info about the system.
**PVJ Version** see which version you have, very useful when opening an issue.
**CPU Temperature** shows actual temp in °C of the CPU, if its over 70°, it will throttle the CPU.
**Powersupply** checks if we get enough current.




AUDIO OUTPUT
************

Select where you want the audio to be played. Limit of compression is: 160kbit/s (you can experiment with higher values, but then decrease the video bitrate).

Do not use "HDMI&Jack" audio output, since this solution results in bad audio quality, its only there if you really really need it :-)

If the quality from mini Jack plug does not make you happy, use audio over HDMI with an extender or you attach an USB soundcard, keep in mind that when they are big, to provide them power from an external powersource.

Im planning to integrate audio over Bluetooth soon... its not working right now..


AUDIO TESTTONE
**************

Testtones

**Volume 100** => sometimes needed if the USB sound level is low.

AUDIO Bluetooth
****************

This is currently a work in progress.

First you need to "install bluetooth" under FIRMWARE.

Then you can click "scan" to show the mac address of a device which you can connect.

Disconnect and pair does not work yet, I am on it but its quite complicated :-)

FIRMWARE
*********

Is for updating stuff.

**Update All** is used to update via zipfile:

see video tutorial:  https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/7/pocketvj-exhibition-update

Always read the release notes, sometimes you need to do this 2x to get all new features.

or: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/6/pocketvj-exhibition-alternative-update

After alternative update, go and click **Update All**, this will add some new stuff in the background.

For precise DMX recording/playback make sure to have the latest OLA 0.10.7 installed!

If you have PVJ Version 4.0.6 or older, you need to install ``pygame`` to use ``Countdown`` and ``Webcam`` preview and also ``Bluetooth`` for beacon stuff.




FACTORY RESET
*************

Resets to factory state.


RENTAL RESET
************

Resets to factory state, removes all movies and images and copys the standard testvideos to the folder.

    OLAD dmx = on/off ==> is used to use dmx/artnet, default: off
