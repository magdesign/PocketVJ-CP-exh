MAPPING
=======

see video tutorial: https://www.pocketvj.com/pocketvj-exhibition

.. note::

    - **If you want to map with a mouse, connect a cabled USB mouse before booting.**

    - "Autostart" into "Mapper" with an USB mouse connected to get everything working.

    - If you use an IR mouse, you need to use an IR Keyboard to control the mapper, CP will not work. 
    
    - Keyboard keys: 1,2,3,4,a,v,b,m,n,l,k,5,7,8,9,0 

    - Use a **Video resolution of 1280 x 720 and a video containing an audiotrack (even silent)**.

    - If the mapped video stutters, decrease the bitrate (see section: Content Creation) and resolution or wait until it played a few times.

    - If its hard to mape due to lags, simple hit the pause button in CP to get more ressources for precise mapping.

    - **There is an "Advanced Mapping Tricks" section in this manual**

    After selecting receiver, you need to reload the mapper, this can be simply done with reopening your preset.
 
    Resolution must be **1280 x 720** and there should be only one video file in Mapper.

    We figured out that the slaves might need a reboot after approx. 15h playback.
