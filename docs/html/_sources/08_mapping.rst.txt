MAPPING
===========

see video tutorial: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/38/mapping_single_channel

.. note::

    - **If you want to map with a mouse, connect a cabled USB mouse before booting.**

    - since CP 4.0.5 and higher, you are able to remotely map without any mouse or keyboard connected, but you must "Autostart" into "Mapper"

    - If you use an IR mouse, you need to use an IR Keyboard to control the mapper, CP will not work. 

    - If you use an IR mouse, you need to use an IR Keyboard to control the mapper, CP will not work.
    
    - Keyboard keys: 1,2,3,4,a,v,b,m,n,l,k,5,7,8,9,0 

    - Use a Video resolution of 1280 x 720 and a video containing an audiotrack (even silent).

    - If the mapped video stutters, decrease the bitrate and resolution or wait until it played a few times.
