DISPLAY
********




.. image:: _images/12_CP_display.png


INFO
******

**Actual Resolution** => See what resoultion we are currently displaying

**Possible** => Ask the attached device which resolution it is capable of

RESOLUTION
************

**Default** => Everytime we boot, we ask the attached device for the biggest possible resolution and use this (this is the default setting)


**1920 x 1080** => Force the PocketVJ to always output in this resolution (needs reboot, no reboot needed since CP 4.3.0a)

.. note::
    - Mapper will only work up to 1920 x 1080 resolution and default flip setting
    - If forced to 1920 x 1200 you may encounter glitch issues!



ROTATE & FLIP
**************

Rotate or flip the output => Needs reboot


SLEEP
******

Set the display/gpu to sleep or wakeup. 

.. note::
    This also disables the GPU which extremely helps to save energy.






PROJECTOR
**********

.. image:: _images/12_CP_projector.png


.. note::  
    - Make sure to connect a PJlink compatible projector via rj45 cable
    - Default ip is: 192.168.2.254
    - For custom ip's make sure to stay in the same range as the PocketVJ's rj45 ip
    - Disable password and powersettings on projector
    - Some projectors act weird, this is not my fault, before complaining check if you are able to power them off (off, not on!!) from CP
    - When coming from a CP older than 4.0.3, make sure to hit "Factory Reset" to change to the new projector control system







see video tutorial: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/25/pocketvj-pjlink-a-projector



If you need a pjlink password, edit:
``/home/pvj/.local/share/pjlink/pjlink.config`` and add a new line containing:
``password = yourpassword``

to do this, access the "Terminal" and type:  ``sudo nano /home/pvj/.local/share/pjlink/pjlink.config``
when done, hit **CTRL+X** and type **Y** to save it.

(I can add a Password input field in CP, just ask for it...)


PROJECTOR IR
*************

This is a bit advanced!

You need to set your remote file first, which can be a cumbersome task,
then add an IR sender as described in IR REMOTE :ref:`irremote` and :ref:`expansion`


The trigger ON file is located in ``/var/www/sync/beameronir``

The trigger OFF file is located in ``/var/www/sync/beameroffir``


HYPERION
********

.. image:: _images/12_CP_hyperion.png
    

Drive WS2812 LED Pixel stripes with the color of the playing video to create an ambient light.
Install Hyperion as described in :ref:`systemsettings`.

You are able to drive the LED from hidden pin19, pin12, pin13. "PocketVJ Exhibtion LED" models have pin12 and pin13 open.
See layout on  :ref:`expansion`

Example in use:


.. image:: _images/12_hyperion_demo.jpg


**Enable Hyperion** => Enables Hyperion and will be active after boot.

**Disable Hyperion** => Disables Hyperion.

**Open Panel** => Open the Hyperion controlpanel.


Shows the Hyperion control panel:

make sure to edit the capture hardware setting as following:

.. image:: _images/12_Capture_setting.png

Depending on which pin you drive the LEDs, change the GPIO number and hit save:

Cabling the leds:

.. image:: _images/12_LED_cabling01.png



.. note::  
    - no audio over jack possible!! only hdmi or alsa.
    - audio will be automatically set to HDMI.
    - if you want to use hyperion together with the mapper, it only works with MapperHDMI


Users of older versions can drill a hole into the case, solder a cable in or write me an email for instructions.
