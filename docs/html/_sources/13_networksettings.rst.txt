see video tutorial: https://video.pocketvj.com/AVideo/video/11/pocketvj-exhibition-wifi-connecting


.. note::
    When connecting to your in-house wifi, there will be no longer a "vj100" hotspot available, so you must make sure to have internet and beeing able to
    remote connect to the device, otherwhise you will lock yourself out!

    **Booting will take a bit longer, since it waits until wifi is connected!**

    After remote accessing with the given ip address shipped with your unit, you can go to "Network Settings" and check the units Wifi IP to access it again directly within your network.

Enable or disable the internal wifi

**ON Permanent** => Turns wifi on also after reboot

**OFF** => Turns wifi and bluetooth off until next reboot

**OFF Permanent** => Turns wifi and bluetooth off  forever


WIFI CHANNEL
************

Change Wifi channels, useful when using multiple PocketVJ's in public spaces to split up the frequencies.


UDP Control
***********

You can control the PocketVJ with UDP commands. On port ``5000``

**Uppercase and lowercase matters!**


When using Packetsender or similar, make sure to send a "Newline" after every command, 

e.g:   ``stop\n``

see here: https://docs.allthingstalk.com/developers/api/udp-messaging/


.. image:: _images/13_udp_packetsender.png


The commands are defined in: https://github.com/magdesign/PocketVJ-CP-exh/blob/master/sync/commandmapping.sh


Ask if you need more control commands and I will add them or edit the file by yourself.



TCP Controouse Wifi with internet so you can accesss from anywhere. example using curl via terminal to control a PocketVJ with the IP: 2.0.0.100

``curl -s http://2.0.0.100/backend.php/?action=stop``

IP://X.X.X:X/backend.php/?action=..............

For more commands check backend.php
Every function is controllable via TCP!
