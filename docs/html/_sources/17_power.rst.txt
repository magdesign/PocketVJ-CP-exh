POWER SUPPLY
============


Make sure to use a 5V 3A micro USB power supply to get a great experience.
The PocketVJ Exhibition might work with less power, but Wifi might come up and down and other issues might occur.
There is a "Powersupply" test button under SYSTEM SETTINGS to check.

DIRECT POWER
============

There is an alternative way to provide the PocketVJ Exhibition with power, keep in mind that following method is an unprotected 
input without any fuse and/or power regulator. If you feed wrong current you might burn the device. There will
be no warranty from my side if you burn the electronics!
